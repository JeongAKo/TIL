# MVVM(Model + View + ViewModel)

![MVVM-Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47776915/185021307-fa08e8db-cb70-4079-ac10-a15b328c481a.png)

- *Model*: App data that the app operates on.
- *View*: The user interface’s visual elements. In iOS, the view controller is inseparable from the concept of the view.
- *ViewModel*: Updates the model from view inputs and updates views from model outputs.

In MVVM, you need a way to bind view model outputs to the views.
